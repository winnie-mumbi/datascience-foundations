"""
Open a new Python program file. Define a function named searchname(). In this function, open 
the file “names.txt” and print its contents using a loop. 

Which one do you think is better? Why?
    - first implementation is better - search_name_1() - because it doesn't remove the last character i.e 5 from the last line (derya 5)

# prints each line while removing the last character from each line i.e '/n' from 1st to 2nd last line
# but removes age from last line because it does not have a newline character
