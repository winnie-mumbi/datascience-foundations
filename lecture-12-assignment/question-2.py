"""
Use a loop from 1 to 100 and print the numbers that satisfy the following conditions:
• Print the numbers that are divisible by 7 and 3
• Print the numbers that are divisible by 7 but not 3
• Print the ODD numbers divisible by 7 but not 3
• Print the numbers that are divisible by the sum of its digits (e.g. 36: 3+9=9 39/9 = 4)
• Print the numbers that are equal to the square of the sum of its digits
